## Solution ##

1. Add bounding box information to the dataset we have collected with segmentation information    
2. Generate pan-optic segmented ground truth data by running DETR on the collected dataset and correcting and adding our classes as necessary
3. Add default stuff classes
4. Train for bounding box prediction for 475 epochs. Train for 25 epochs for segmentation
